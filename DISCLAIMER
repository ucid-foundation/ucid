DATA DISCLAIMER

The urban context scores, grades, and metrics provided by UCID are derived
from publicly available data sources including OpenStreetMap, GTFS feeds,
and other open datasets. These scores are provided for informational and
research purposes only and should not be:

1. Used as the sole basis for urban planning decisions
2. Considered definitive measures of urban quality
3. Applied without local validation and expert review
4. Used for regulatory compliance without proper verification

The accuracy of scores depends on the quality and currency of underlying
data sources. Users are responsible for validating results against
authoritative local sources before making decisions.

GEOGRAPHIC DATA DISCLAIMER

UCID uses the H3 hexagonal spatial indexing system developed by Uber
Technologies. The spatial indexing is approximate and should not be used
for precise boundary determination or legal property delineation.

City boundaries and codes are approximate and may not align with official
administrative boundaries. Coverage areas are indicative only.
